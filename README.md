# Getting started

## Prerequisites
When copying the code blocks from this repository, always remove the leading dollar signs. They prevent the pasted
command from being executed instantly, thus minimizing attack vectors. **Always be careful what you paste into your
command line.**

- [ ] If you don't have a machine to code on, buy yourself one of the older ThinkPad laptops - they are very
cheap. Make it your dedicated coding hardware.
- [ ] Install Ubuntu ([19.04](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop/thank-you?country=PL&version=19.04&architecture=amd64) as of time of writing)

## Install Python
- [ ] Install asdf for managing Python (and other) versions
```
$ sudo apt install \
    automake autoconf libreadline-dev \
    libncurses-dev libssl-dev libyaml-dev \
    libxslt-dev libffi-dev libtool unixodbc-dev \
    unzip curl
```

- [ ] Install Python plugin via asdf
```
$ asdf plugin-add python
```

- [ ] Install Python prerequisites (optional, in case of errors)
```

$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get upgrade
$ sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
$ sudo apt-get install build-essential python-dev python-setuptools python-pip python-smbus
$ sudo apt-get install libncursesw5-dev libgdbm-dev libc6-dev
$ sudo apt-get install zlib1g-dev libsqlite3-dev tk-dev
$ sudo apt-get install libssl-dev openssl
$ sudo apt-get install libffi-dev
```

- [ ] Install Python via asdf
```
$ asdf install python 3.7.4
```

- [ ] Set installed Python as global default
```
$ asdf global python 3.7.4
```

- [ ] Try out installation (run interactive console)
```
$ python
```

## Next steps:
- [ ] Go through [Automate the Boring Stuff tutorial](https://automatetheboringstuff.com)

Total beginner level, I like it very much after a few chapters. It assumes no prior programming knowledge, so the first
chapters are very simple to go through.

- [ ] Go through [CS50â€™s Web Programming with Python and JavaScript](https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2019/spring/lectures/)

- [ ] Go through [Learn Code the Hard Way](https://learncodethehardway.org/python/)

## Still feeling not confident enough?
At this point you are probably better than 90% of the world when it comes to the coding - you have solid knowledge for a beginner level. You should probably stop reading and start writing some code though. If you are having problems with that, message me via any preferred communication channel or:

- [ ] Go through [Google's Python Class](https://developers.google.com/edu/python/)
